# Class 11th Marks Calculator

This program is designed to simplify the process of calculating marks for Class 11 and 12 students, where the marking scheme is more intricate compared to earlier classes. Throughout the academic year, marks from four key exams are considered:

1. **Periodic Test 1 (PT-1)**  
2. **Half Yearly Exam (HY)**  
3. **Periodic Test 2 (PT-2)**  
4. **Session Ending Examination (SSE)**  

For all exams, a minimum score of **33%** in both the **theory (exam marks)** and **practical/assessment marks** is required for a student to pass. Students scoring below this threshold in either component are classified as having failed.

The program accounts for the unique marking schemes of practical and non-practical subjects and calculates aggregate marks accordingly.

## Practical Subjects

Practical subjects include **Physics**, **Chemistry**, and **Computer Science**. 

### Exam Mark Distribution:
- **PT-1 and PT-2:** Conducted out of 40 marks each.  
- **HY and SSE:** Conducted out of 70 marks each.

### Aggregate Calculation:
- **PT-1 and PT-2:** 10% of marks from each test are added.  
- **HY:** 30% of marks are considered.  
- **SSE:** 50% of marks are considered.

The aggregate marks (out of 100) are then scaled to a maximum of 70. Additionally:
- Practical and internal assessments contribute 30 marks.
- The final total (marks + assessments) is out of 100.

## Non-Practical Subjects

Non-practical subjects include **Mathematics** and **English**.

### Exam Mark Distribution:
- **PT-1 and PT-2:** Conducted out of 40 marks each.  
- **HY and SSE:** Conducted out of 80 marks each.

### Aggregate Calculation:
- **PT-1 and PT-2:** 10% of marks from each test are added.  
- **HY:** 30% of marks are considered.  
- **SSE:** 50% of marks are considered.

The aggregate marks (out of 100) are then scaled to a maximum of 80. Additionally:
- Internal assessments contribute 20 marks.
- The final total (marks + assessments) is out of 100.
